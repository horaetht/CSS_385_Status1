My idea is to create a Texas Holdâ€™em 1v1 poker game where a human plays against an AI opponent. 
The project will simulate dealing cards, betting rounds (pre-flop, flop, turn, river), and evaluate hands to determine the winner. 
The AI will make decisions based on random choice at first and later be improved with hand-strength evaluation.
The main focus on this project is using maths to control the AI making the decision, especially what we called is GTO*
